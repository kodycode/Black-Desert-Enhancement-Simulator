# Instructions
- Click any desired weapon from equipment window
- Right click or double click on weapon to start enhancing
- Click Enhance button
- Enhance away!
- To toss out any unwanted items, simply drag the item outside of the inventory window.
- You can also re-arrange items by simply dragging an item over another item.
- You can now switch between 'characters' for another failstack counter

The site uses 'Marcellus' as a font so browser font may differ from screenshot.

# Changelog
- [9/19/2017] Fixed a bug with accessories not working, as well as a fix for failstacks not working as intended yet again. I do apologize for all the mess I've been causing. I've yet to find accurate values for the enhancement simulator to use so changes will continue. Suggestions are welcomed.
- [9/16/2017] Added striker weapons, fixed some bugs, and modified the enhancement formula as it was not actually working as I intended it to.
- [7/30/2017] Cleaned up some code and moved some functions to their own files. I also fixed a bug with failstacks being used on weapons that were below the enhancement rank 7.
- [7/2/2017] Adjusted display of Enhancement attempts in the pop-out window. To simply put it, once an equipment reaches +15, I split the success/fail enhancement counts when you hover over an item so it's easier to indicate how many concentrated black stones and regular black stones you've used so far during enhancement. 'Pre-15:' followed by a number indicates the regular black stone weapons used to get to 15.
- [7/1/2017] Added Dark Knight weapons. Striker weapons coming later.
- [5/7/2017] Added sounds while you enhance now. Also added a mute checkbox if you wish to enhance without any sounds. Code cleanups.
- [5/3/2017] Removed tossing items into the trash bin and instead provided a convenient way to get rid of items by just tossing them outside of the inventory window. Minor adjustments.
