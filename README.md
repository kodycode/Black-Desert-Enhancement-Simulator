The site uses 'Marcellus' as a font so browser font may differ from screenshot.

# Changelog
- [7/2/2017] Adjusted display of Enhancement attempts in the pop-out window. To simply put it, once an equipment reaches +15, I split the success/fail enhancement counts when you hover over an item so it's easier to indicate how many concentrated black stones and regular black stones you've used so far during enhancement. 'Pre-15:' followed by a number indicates the regular black stone weapons used to get to 15.
- [7/1/2017] Added Dark Knight weapons. Striker weapons coming later.
- [5/7/2017] Added sounds while you enhance now. Also added a mute checkbox if you wish to enhance without any sounds. Code cleanups.
- [5/3/2017] Removed tossing items into the trash bin and instead provided a convenient way to get rid of items by just tossing them outside of the inventory window. Minor adjustments.
